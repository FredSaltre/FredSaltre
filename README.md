## Background
I am an ecologist interested in how ecosystems change through space and time. I combine modelling approaches with fossil data and genetic knowledge to inform how human pressure and climate changes modified ecosystem functioning such as distributions and interactions of plants, animals, humans, and environments, from a deep-time perspective. I write about ecology and climate change over time from the Late Pleistocene (~126,000 years ago) to the present day, and how our understanding of the past can help prepare us for the future.

I joined Flinders University in the College of Science and Engineering in July 2017 as Research Fellow in Ecological Modelling for the ARC Centre of Excellence for Australian Biodiversity and Heritage. I am the Coordinator of the Global Ecology Laboratory (with Professor Corey Bradshaw) and a member of the Weisbecker Lab (with Associate Professor Vera Weisbecker).

From 2013 to 2017, I was an ARC Research Associate at the University of Adelaide. Previously, I held a joint one year appointment with the Centre for Bio-Archaeology and Ecology and the School of Advanced Studies (EPHE) as Lecturer at Montpellier (France), and was a Postdoctoral Scholar at the Oregon State University (USA).
